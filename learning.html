            <h2>Learning 1</h2>
            <p>
                On 20th February 2023, I learned about the introdunction that is how to introduce myself (eg. I am Roshan Aswal not My name is Roshan Aswal)
                next I learned what are the major points i need to mention as the overall content of my whole introduction for the long introduction as well as 
                the quick introduction.Some points are like I can introduce my family(optional), education and the skills which i am good at.Some other topics
                like projects can be used to direct the interview in certain direction which can be helpful in gaining interviewer's trust on my most proficient 
                skill. Besides the project if i have any work experience then i should tell interviewer about the company where i worked, duration of intern
                also the learnings from the internship. At last the hobbies mentioned by me should also be in context with the overall productivity in my work like i like to listen music which
                helps to relieve my stress.
            </p>
            <h2>Learning 2</h2>
            <p>
                I learned about the resume building,there are some major points and some minor points to be noted about one's resume.Some major are - your
                name,email address to get in touch with you, phone number to get calls if you are shorlisted then comes your academic details from recent to
                last like UG->12th->10th. Other section about your projects you created and then the subjects you have learnt during your course, this helps
                interviewer to get the data for discussion about and interviewee. Next section includes about Achievements and the certifications you have
                achieved during your academics which adds credibility with your skills mentioned in resume.Another optional section relates to the extra 
                ciricular activities like if you have managed any kind of event or took participate in.
            </p>
            <h2>Learning 3</h2>
            <p>
                I learned about the personal interview,firstly Sir taught us about 2 kind of introductions first which is brief and usually should be finisehed
                under 1min, if interviewer asks about full interview then there is another introduction which tells about us in more detail and the duration of
                the long introduction is more than 2-3 minutes.Next thing i learned from Sir is that try to move the flow of interview towards the direction overall
                field where i have most confidence and discuss on the topics which i am more confident about, this can be done using the projects only which are done
                entirely by me and have detailed knowledge. In interview we have to be ready for critical thinking and HOTS questions like situational based questions
                which checks our thinking ability.
            </p>
            <h2>Learning 4</h2>
            <p>
                I learned about group discussion where Sir taught us crucial points to stand out in a group discussion.He firstly told that the person who initiates
                the discussion will always get extra marks for this and work as ice breaker for the discussion.The points said as the initiater should be neutral
                and it does not show any kind of biased opinion as this is discussion not a debate further it opens a vast amount of topics to be choose and speak 
                about for others which makes discussion healthy.Next thing i learned about group discussion is there can be times where i don't know the topic then i 
                should wait and listen to others first then make my opinion and tell my point about the topic which allow me to participate in discussion 
                even i am lacking in knowledge about topic.Sir gave us few areas which can help to pick topic's different opinion accordint to that area like - political,
                social,natural,religious etc.

            <h2>Week 1</h2>
            <p>
                On 20th February 2023, I learned about the introdunction that is how to introduce myself (eg. I am Roshan Aswal not My name is Roshan Aswal)
                next I learned what are the major points i need to mention as the overall content of my whole introduction for the long introduction as well as 
                the quick introduction.Some points are like I can introduce my family(optional), education and the skills which i am good at.Some other topics
                like projects can be used to direct the interview in certain direction which can be helpful in gaining interviewer's trust on my most proficient 
                skill. Besides the project if i have any work experience then i should tell interviewer about the company where i worked, duration of intern
                also the learnings from the internship. At last the hobbies mentioned by me should also be in context with the overall productivity in my work like i like to listen music which
                helps to relieve my stress.

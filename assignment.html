                <li style="text-decoration: underline;font-size: large;">Favourite Dialogue</li> 
                <p>"You will have bad time but that will always wake you up to the
                    good stuff you weren't paying attention to"<br>
                    I really liked this dialogue because it tells us about the truth of life that bad times
                    that we try to avoid comes with the opportunity sometimes to get out of our comfort zone and
                    explore the new boundaries.

                <p>
                    This movies shows the life of a genius boy who can solve toughest academic problems
                    which normal human can't easily solve but die to some past trauma he suffers from trust
                    issues, fear of love and other believe like being left alone. It shows beautifully that
                    a person is not only a puppet to grab the next big thing or chasing success,he can choose his 
                    own life and can live the way he wants. There is no boundation to any human in terma of getting
                    what they want.<br>
                    This movie shows the bond of friendship and love between characters which keep the pace of movie
                    slow but engaging.

                <p>
                    First thing i learned from this movie is a person is free and they can choose the direction
                    of their life according to their will. Second is that success or being rich is not only the
                    path of happiness and last thing i learned is that friendship and love can help person to 
                    recover a person from even the darkest moments in their life.
